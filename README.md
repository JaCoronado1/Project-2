# Project-2
During this course I was able to learn a lot about the most efficient ways to sort data. The task that I was assigned for projects during this course was using different methods to search for information and finding the most efficient way based on data needed. I was able to approach this by referencing support articles and understanding why certain data structures are so important. I was able to overcome roadblocks by ustlizing my resources and using past assignments this made the final project much easier to complete. This was probably one of my favorite course as I learned about making efficient code and using better processes. I think now moving forward when developing a application I have much more insight into different ways to manage the information. This class has helped me think better, and be able to find the correct solution for the best result.
